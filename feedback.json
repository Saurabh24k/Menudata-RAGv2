Let the dough rise: Place the kneaded dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place for about 45 minutes, or until doubled in size.\n\n3. Preheat oven: Preheat your oven to the highest temperature, aiming for 475-500\u00b0F (245-260\u00b0C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.\n\n4. Prepare your toppings: Gather your desired toppings, such as tomato sauce, cheese, and your choice of meats, vegetables, or herbs.\n\n5. Roll out the dough: Turn the risen dough onto a floured surface and roll it out to your desired thickness, keeping the thickness consistent.\n\n6.

Add sauce and toppings: Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, followed by your desired toppings and cheese.\n\n8.
